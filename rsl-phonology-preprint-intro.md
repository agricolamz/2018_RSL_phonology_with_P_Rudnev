# Introduction #


Despite the abundance of research into the phonological systems of sign languages precipitated by the seminal work of @Stokoe:1960, full-scale phonological descriptions of individual sign languages are extremely rare, American Sign Language (ASL) being a notable exception [@Stokoe:1960; @Sandler:1989, amongst many others]. More typical of research into sign language phonology is the situation where narrowly defined problems are given a solution based on considering individual aspects of individual sign language phonologies [@Battison:1974; @Lane:1976; @Boyes:1982; @Wilbur:1990; @Siedlecki:1993; @Sandler:1996; @Sandier:1999; @Fontana:2008; @Pfau:2008; @Israel:2009; @Brentari:2011]. Other sign languages whose phonological systems have been described in their entirety include Sign Language of the Netherlands [@vanderKooij:2002], British Sign Language [@Channon:2002], Turkish Sign Language [@Kubucs:2008], and, recently, Russian Sign Language [RSL, @Plaskovitskaya:2018] is the first attempt at checking the predictions of existing theories formulated on the basis of other sign languages for RSL, and compiling a preliminary set of phonological primitives and sketching their composition.


This paper aims at showcasing the phonological diversity of RSL on the basis of a description of the RSL phonological system in its entirety, whilst also testing its descriptive adequacy.

Having analysed 400 monosyllabic verbs from Plaskovitskaya's [-@Plaskovitskaya:2018] annotated corpus of the Belarusian dialect of RSL, we claim that using even a modest set of data in combination with a crude phonological description [@Plaskovitskaya:2018] it is possible to detect clear-cut phonological patterns. 

The paper is structured as follows. First, in @sec:properties, we sketch what we consider to be the consensus picture in the sign language literature as regards the internal composition of sign language lexical items, and introduce the difficulties surrounding the identification of segments inside them. Then, we proceed, in @sec:data, to explicate our data and method. We present our results in @sec:results, and discuss their statistical and theoretical significance in @sec:discussion.
