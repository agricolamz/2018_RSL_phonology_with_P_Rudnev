# Introduction #

Despite the abundance of research into the phonological systems of sign languages precipitated by the seminal work of @Stokoe:1960, full-scale phonological descriptions of individual sign languages are extremely rare, American Sign Language (ASL) being a notable exception [@Stokoe:1960; @Sandler:1989, amongst many others]. Other sign languages whose phonological systems have been described in their entirety include Sign Language of the Netherlands [NGT, @vanderKooij:2002], and, recently, Russian Sign Language (RSL), @Plaskovitskaya:2018 being the first attempt at compiling a phoneme inventory for RSL. More typical of research into sign language phonology is the situation where narrowly defined problems are given a solution based on considering individual aspects of individual sign language phonologies. EXAMPLES with REFERENCES 

This paper aims at showcasing the phonological diversity of RSL on the basis of a description of the RSL phonological system in its entirety, whilst also testing its descriptive adequacy. 

Having analysed 400 monosyllabic verbs from Plaskovitskaya's [-@Plaskovitskaya:2018] annotated corpus of the Belarusian dialect of RSL, we claim that using even a modest set of data in combination with a crude phonological description [@Plaskovitskaya:2018] it is possible to detect clear-cut phonological patterns. 

The paper is structured as follows.
