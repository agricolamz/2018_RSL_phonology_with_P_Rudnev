# Internal structure of sign language signs #

This section lays out our background assumptions regarding the internal structure of lexical items in sign languages, which is based on broadly the same set of principles in most sign languages studied to date.

Since sign languages are natural languages, it stands to reason that sign language lexical items, or signs, possess the very same highly constrained and organised internal complexity as their spoken language counterparts, decomposing into combinations of features and their attributes. Unlike in spoken languages, however, the sublexical elements in sign languages are not ordered sequentially but can be realised simultaneously due to the absence in the visual-gestural modality of articulatory constraints imposed by the auditory modality. Traditionally, the following structural elements of a sign are identified: handshape, hand orientation, place of articulation, movement, trajectory, and non-manual marking. Frequently, none of these is capable of carrying lexical information.
