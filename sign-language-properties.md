# RSL and the internal structure of signs {#sec:properties}

This section briefly describes the sociolinguistic context surrounding RSL and lays out our background assumptions regarding the internal structure of lexical items in sign languages, which is based on broadly the same set of principles in most sign languages studied to date.[^2]

## RSL: key facts {#sec:rsl-key-facts}

Russian Sign Language is a natural sign language used by Deaf and hard-of-hearing people as well as children of Deaf adults (CODA) in the Russian Federation and some post-Soviet states (e.g. Belarus, Kazakhstan and the Ukraine). It is also used alongside Estonian Sign Language in Estonia, where its use is restricted to ethnic Russians. According to the 2010 population census, approximately 121,000 people are native signers of RSL in Russia, most of whom, as is commonly the case [@Emmorey:2008], are bilingual with Russian. The census results group the Deaf, hard-of-hearing, and CODA signers together as native signers.

According to @Burkova:2012, RSL displays a significant amount of regional dialectal variation that is primarily restricted to the lexical domain, though the exact numbers quantifying the lexical differences between the Moscow and Siberian dialects, or the Moscow dialect and the Belarusian dialect are as yet unavailable. In the absence of evidence to the contrary and for the purposes of this paper, we treat the observed contrasts as invariant.

Despite a growing number of publications on various aspects of RSL [cf. @Kimmelman:2014 *et seq.* on RSL syntax and information structure; БУРКОВА, Маша К., Лиза и т. п. LIST MORE REFERENCES!], the language in general, and its phonology in particular, still remain severely understudied. Before we address the issue of identifying RSL phonological primitives, a few general remarks are in order on the approach and method of sign language phonology.

## Sign languages and their phonologies {#sec:sl-phonologies}

Since sign languages are natural languages, it stands to reason that sign language lexical items, or signs, possess the very same highly constrained and organised internal complexity as their spoken language counterparts, decomposing into combinations of semantic, syntactic and phonological features and feature attributes. Unlike phonemes and morphemes in spoken languages, however, the sublexical elements in sign languages are not ordered sequentially but can be realised simultaneously due to the absence in the visual-gestural modality of articulatory constraints imposed by the auditory modality. Traditionally, the following structural elements of a sign are identified: handshape, hand orientation, place of articulation, movement, trajectory, and non-manual marking. Frequently, none of these is capable of independently carrying lexical information, as can be demonstrated for the RSL sign for \textsc{moscow} shown in @Fig:moskva. The sign in question consists of the following identifiable sublexical units:

  * **handshape:** fist
  * **orientation:** vertical, palm facing inwards
  * **place of articulation:** dominant hand side of chin
  * **trajectory:** towards signer
  * **movement:** repeated
  * **non-manual component:** mouthing *[maskva]* ‘Moscow’ in Russian

None of the individual sign parameters just listed for the \textsc{moscow} sign above carries lexical semantic information, which only appears once they are assembled together, and behave like phonological features in spoken languages. Moreover, substituting one of them for another can create minimal pairs, just as is the case with phonological features in spoken languages. To illustrate, changing the trajectory  of the repeated fist movement at the chin on the side of the dominant hand from straight to clockwise circular changes the sign's lexical meaning from \textsc{moscow} to \textsc{grandmother}, yet the movements in question themselves (i.e. straight *vs.* circular) are not uniquely associated with the lexical semantics of either *Moscow* or *grandmother* since they recur in numerous lexically unrelated signs. Thus, both \textsc{moscow} and \textsc{grandmother} are arbitrary in the Saussurean sense.

Nevertheless, a significant proportion of sign language vocabulary is iconic, which makes identifying phonological primitives and even segments, as well as determining their composition a non-trivial task. Moreover, scouring the sign language phonology literature creates an impression that the number of features differentiating one lexical item from another is virtually limitless, especially when several sign languages are considered simultaneously, whilst there are surprisingly few explicit arguments in favour of ascribing those features a phonological status. On the contrary, the number of minimal pairs relative to the vast number of features is exceedingly small, which has to do with the iconic character of certain sublexical elements carrying semantic information whose status as morphemes is problematic. Indeed, once these items are subtracted from a sign, the remaining residue does not constitute a morpheme either [see @vanderKooij:2002 for a detailed discussion of iconicity-related problems for sign language phonology].

To solve the problem of the overabundance of phonological primitives in sign language phonologies, @vanderKooij:2002 proposes to only use minimal (or near-minimal) pairs, and treat as phonetic/prosodic residue those surface realisations that are predictable on the basis of either the phonological or semantic environment in which they occur.

In this paper we adopt van der Kooij's [-@vanderKooij:2002] approach of constructing minimal pairs and augment it by subjecting the preliminarily identified phonological primitives to statistical testing. In particular, we employ the Multiple Correspondence Analysis technique with a view to determining if the primitives in question form natural classes in a manner roughly similar to the way in which vowels and consonants of spoken languages form natural classes with a few elements in between.
