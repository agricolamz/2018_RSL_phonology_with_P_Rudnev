# Internal structure of sign language signs #

This section lays out our background assumptions regarding the internal structure of lexical items in sign languages, which is based on broadly the same set of principles in most sign languages studied to date.

Since sign languages are natural languages, it stands to reason that sign language lexical items, or signs, possess the very same highly constrained and organised internal complexity as their spoken language counterparts, decomposing into combinations of features and their attributes. Unlike in spoken languages, however, the sublexical elements in sign languages are not ordered sequentially but can be realised simultaneously due to the absence in the visual-gestural modality of articulatory constraints imposed by the auditory modality. Traditionally, the following structural elements of a sign are identified: handshape, hand orientation, place of articulation, movement, trajectory, and non-manual marking. Frequently, none of these is capable of carrying lexical information: the RSL sign for \textsc{moscow} (Figure 1), for instance, can be analysed thus:

  * **handshape:** fist
  * **orientation:** vertical, palm facing inwards
  * **place of articulation:** dominant hand side of chin
  * **trajectory:** towards signer
  * **movement:** repeated
  * **non-manual component:** mouthing *Moskva* ‘Moscow’ in Russian

None of the individual sign parameters just listed carries lexical semantic information, which only appears once they are assembled together, and behave exactly like phonemes in spoken languages. Moreover, substituting one of them for another can create minimal pairs, just as is the case with phonemes in spoken languages. To illustrate, changing the trajectory  of the repeated fist movement at the chin on the side of the dominant hand from straight to clockwise circular changes the \textsc{moscow} sign's lexical meaning from \textsc{moscow} to \textsc{grandmother}.

Nevertheless, a significant proportion of sign language vocabulary is iconic, which makes identifying phonological primitives and even segments, and determining their composition a non-trivial task [see @vanderKooij:2002 for a detailed discussion of iconicity-related problems for sign language phonology].
