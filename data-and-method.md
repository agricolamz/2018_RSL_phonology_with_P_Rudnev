# Data and method #

The corpus consists of  400 ELAN v.5.1-annotated, primarily monomorphemic, verbs taken from the [*Spread the Sign* dictionary](http://www.spreadthesign.com/be/) in the Belarusian dialect of Russian Sign Language. The theoretical model buttressing the annotation is Van der Kooij's [-@vanderKooij:2002] Dependency model with minor modifications. The data, their annotation and the dedicated script to facilitate navigation are all available as a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ToszaPlaskovickaja/Term_paper) at [https://github.com/ToszaPlaskovickaja/Term_paper](https://github.com/ToszaPlaskovickaja/Term_paper).
