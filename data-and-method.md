# Data and method #

The data for our study comes from an annotated corpus presented in Plaskovitskaya [-@Plaskovitskaya:2018], whose main aim was to test the predictions of existing approaches to SL phonology against the data from RSL, and to compile a preliminary inventory of phonological primitives in RSL as well as sketch a model of their compositional interaction.

The corpus consists of  400 ELAN v.5.1-annotated, primarily monomorphemic, verbs taken from the [*Spread the Sign* dictionary](http://www.spreadthesign.com/be/) in the Belarusian dialect of Russian Sign Language. The theoretical model buttressing the annotation is Van der Kooij's [-@vanderKooij:2002] Dependency model with minor modifications. The data, their annotation and the dedicated script to facilitate navigation are all available as a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ToszaPlaskovickaja/Term_paper) at [https://github.com/ToszaPlaskovickaja/Term_paper](https://github.com/ToszaPlaskovickaja/Term_paper).
