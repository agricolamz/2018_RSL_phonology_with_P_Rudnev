# Discussion {#sec:discussion}

Put discussion here.

A further issue with Plaskovitskaya's original annotation scheme concerned its reliance on lexical items rather than segments: for the purposes of her study, @Plaskovitskaya:2018 treats all lexical items as single segments in their own right.

* WHY DO WE THINK THIS IS A PROBLEM?
    * (put differently, why did we want to reannotate everything as either 1- or 2-hand signs?)
