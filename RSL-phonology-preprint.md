* detailed descriptions of individual sign language phonological systems are rare: the most is known about ASL [@Sandler:1989], NGT [@vanderKooij:2002]; @Plaskovitskaya:2018 is the first attempt of compiling a phoneme inventory for RSL
* more typical of phonological research on SLs are solutions to narrowly formulated problems (EXAMPLES)
* aims
    * showcase the phonological diversity of SL lexicon based on the phonological description of the RSL phonological system in its entirety
    * verify the existing phonological description of RSL, suggest improvements
* claims
    * using even a modest amount of data and a crude phonological description it is possible to detect some large phonological patterns in SL lexicon
    * SEGMENTS!!!
    * the model 
* materials and method
    * phonological description of the Belarusian dialect of RSL [@Plaskovitskaya:2018] 
    * and her annotation of ca.Â 400 verbal forms from the SpreadTheSign database; 515 segments identified
    * MCA analysis for all entries
* we discovered 3 clusters corresponding to 
    * two-hand signs 
    * cluster 2 (defined by H1 features including movement to a physiologically less tense position)
    * cluster 3 (less marked class comprising one-hand signs defined by H1 features including movement to a physiologically more tense position)
    * the MCA groups the values of the Width, Curve and Aperture nodes from @Plaskovitskaya:2018 together, hinting at a potential simplification of her model. In particular,
