* detailed descriptions of individual sign language phonological systems are rare (van der Kooij; Plaskovitskaya + some more)
* more typical of phonological research on SLs are solutions to narrowly formulated problems (EXAMPLES)
* SLs and their properties
    * iconicity
    * segments (REF) aren't easily identifiable 
    * *ergo* determining the phonological primitives and their composition is far from obvious
* aims
    * showcase phonological diversity of SL lexicon based on the phonological description of the RSL phonological system in its entirety
* claims
    * using even a small amount of data and a crude phonological description it is possible to detect some large phonological patterns in SL lexicon
* materials and method
    * phonological description of the Belarusian dialect of RSL [@Plaskovitskaya:2018] 
    * and her annotation of ca.Â 400 monosyllabic (REF!) verbal forms from the SpreadTheSign database
    * MCA analysis for all entries
* we discovered 3 clusters corresponding to 
    * two-hand signs 
    * cluster 2
    * cluster 3
